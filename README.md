# FlightSearch
An iPhone app to search flight statuses built for a coding challenge

### Coding Challenge Instructions:

1) Flight search
Inputs: Airline code (e.g.: AA, support only the code, not need to support American Airlines), Flight number, departure date

2) Use FlightStats API, json format

3) Show Flights (1 or more possible, e.g.: AA 138)
- try to display the most relevant information in a user friendly way
- don't use the same search screen
- allow the user to refresh the flight info
- add a label that shows the last time it was updated, e.g.: "Updated: 2 minutes ago"
- offline mode (no internet): the user should be able to see the last flight shown, there is no "save flight" button, so no need to persist all fights, just the last one for offline access

4) General requirements
- keep the design simple
- show progress bars when needed
- write at least 2 non trivial unit tests
- design for vertical orientation, then handle screen rotation
- support 2 screen resolutions
- try to code the app as if it was the 1st step of a bigger app, so focus on the software design, comments, clean code, etc.
